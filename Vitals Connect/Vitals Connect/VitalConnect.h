 * @mainpage Vital Connect iPhone Library
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This documentation set covers the Vital Connect library API for iPhone.  The Vital Connect library provides iPhone application developers access to the functionality of the Vital Connect vital signs monitoring and notification system.  The Vital Connect system includes a Bluetooth low energy technology vital signs sensor, the Vital Connect iPhone library, the Vital Connect cloud-based data storage, and notification infrastructure. This infrastructure provides analytics and chronic condition monitoring. Application developers can use this API to enhance their applications with the full range of functionality provided by the Vital Connect system.
 *
 * @section install_sec Installation
 * @subsection prior SDK Versions prior to 2.2.5
 * The library and associated sample code is shipped as an OS X package file. To install the library and associated sample code, double-click the package file, which  runs the package installer.  Accept the software license to install the library and sample code to ~/Desktop/VitalConnectLibrary.  Then restart Xcode to get Xcode to recognize the documentation.
 
 * @subsection andbeyond SDK Versions 2.2.5 and beyond

 The library and associated sample code is shipped as a zip file. To install the library and associated sample code, double-click the zip file, which will decompress the files into a VitalConnectLibrary directory in the current directory.  To make the documentation available to Xcode, copy the VitalConnectLibrary/Docs/com.vitalconnect.library.docset file to ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets and restart Xcode to recognize the new docset.
 
 * @subsection common All Versions

 The sample application can be built and run directly from the installation directory, and the library can be added to existing projects by copying the .a and .h files from the VitalConnectLibrary/Lib subdirectory into your project directory.
 
 Add the following key into info.plist to allow background Bluetooth processing in the application:
 key: UIBackgroundModes value:bluetooth-central
 
 *
 * @section using_sec Using the Library
 *
 * @subsection initializing_sec Initializing the Library
 * To use the library, you must have a valid API key.  This is an NSString value provided to you by Vital Connect to help us verify authorized usage of the library.   The library is initialized using the following code snippet:
 
 @code
 [VitalConnectManager createVitalConnect:@"<Your API key here>" 
                             environment:kVitalConnectServerDevelopment
                             rootFileDir:rootFileDirForStoringLogsAndOtherFiles
                               encrypted:isEncryptDeviceData];
 
 VitalConnectManager *vitalConnectManager = [[VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance] start];
 
 @endcode
 
 * Once initialized, the application should check to see if a valid relay GUID has been assigned to the library.  If not, the application should retrieve a relay GUID from the Vital Connect web services API and register the GUID with the library:
 
 @code
 -(void) doRegisterRelay {
 
 VitalConnectBackendErrorCode errorCode = [[VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance] registerRelay:SDK_RELAY_ID passCode:SDK_RELAY_PASSWORD];
 switch (errorCode) {
 case kBackendError_Success:
 {
 NSLog(@"RelayID given to library");
 break;
 }
 default:
 {
 [self performSelector:@selector(doRegisterRelay) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.0];
 break;
 }
 }
 }
 
 ...
 
 NSString * relayGUID = [self.vitalConnectManager getRelayIdentifier];
 if (relayGUID == nil || relayGUID.length == 0) {
 NSLog(@"Registering relay...");
 [self performSelector:@selector(doRegisterRelay) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.0];
 } else {
 NSLog(@"Using relay id: %@", relayGUID);
 }
 @endcode
 
 
 
 
 * @subsection connecting_sec Connecting to a sensor
 Once the library is initialized, the application can receive sensor events by declaring itself a VitalConnectConnectionListener, and registering itself with the VitalConnectManager:
 @code
 [vitalConnectManager addListener:self withNotificationsOnMainThread:YES];
 @endcode
 
 Then it can start scanning for devices:
 
 @code
 VitalConnectManager *vitalConnectManager = [VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance];
 [vitalConnectManager startScan];
 @endcode
 
 The application object will receive a notification that a device was seen via the VitalConnectConnectionListener interface.  A typical implementation of the didSeeNewSensor: and didConnectToSensor: methods is:
 
 @code
 -(void) didSeeNewSensor:(VitalConnectSensor *)sensor {
 [vitalConnectManager connectSensor:sensor forSensorSource: @"<your sensor source GUID>];
 
 }
 
 -(void) didConnectToSensor:(VitalConnectSensor *)sensor {
 //wahoo!  we are connected!
 }
 
 @endcode
 
 * @subsection registering_sec Registering for data events
 The application can register for many sensor data events.  The following code registers the application to receive battery level events - real time updates of the sensor battery level.
 
 @code
 VitalConnectManager* vcManager = [VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance];
 [vcManager addObserver: self selector:@selector(receivedBatteryChange:) name: kVCIObserverBattery];
 
 -(void)receivedBatteryChange: (NSNotification *)notification {
 NSDictionary *dict = (NSDictionary *)notification.object;
 NSNumber *batteryLevel = [dict objectForKey:kVCIObserverKeyBatteryLevel];
 //do something with this new battery level
 }
 
 }
 @endcode
 
 * @subsection notification_sec Watches and Notifications
 The application can set watches and receive notifications that the watch conditions have been met.  The following code shows how to do this for a fall watch.  The first step is to implement the VitalConnectWatchManagerObserver interface:
 
 @code
 // define your class to implement the VitalConnectWatchManagerObserver interface
 @interface THFWatchListViewController : UIViewController <VitalConnectWatchManagerObserver>
 ...
 @end
 @endcode
 
 In your class, register yourself as an observer, and create some watches:
 
 @code
 NSString *sensorSourceGUID = @"<sensor source GUID>"
 
 VitalConnectManager* vcManager = [VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance];
 // register for the
 [vcManager addWatchManagerObserver:self forSensorSource:sensorSourceGUID];
 
 [vcManager createEventWatchForSensorSource:sensorSourceGUID
 DataKey: kVCIWatchTypeFall
 Confirmation: NO];
 
 [vcManager createThresholdWatchForSensorSource:sensorSourceGUID
 DataKey: kVCIObserverKeyBpm
 Severity: kVitalConnectThresholdWatchSeverityLimit
 Bound: kVitalConnectThresholdWatchBoundAbove
 Confirmation: NO
 ThresholdValue: @90];
 @endcode
 
 The application object that registers as an watch manager observer will get a notification using the watchManagerTriggeredWatch method:
 
 @code
 - (void) watchManagerTriggeredWatch:(id<VitalConnectWatch>)watch byNotification:(NSString*)localNotificationId At:(NSDate*)triggerTime {
 //do something with the notification here!
 }
 @endcode
 
 * @subsection lifecycle_sec Handling application lifecycle events
 Because the library deals with background Bluetooth activity and stores data, the application should send application lifecycle events to the library from your AppDelegate:
 
 @code
 
 - (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application
 {
 VitalConnectManager* vcManager = [VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance];
 [vcManager applicationWillResignActive];
 }
 
 - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
 {
 VitalConnectManager* vcManager = [VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance];
 [vcManager applicationDidBecomeActive];
 }
 
 - (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application
 {
 VitalConnectManager* vcManager = [VitalConnectManager getSharedInstance];
 [vcManager applicationWillTerminate];
 }
 
 @endcode
